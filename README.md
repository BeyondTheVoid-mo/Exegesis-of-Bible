## ✝️ Project Overview

This repository is developed and maintained by [AmenLink](https://AmenLink.xyz),  
containing **systematic exegetical documents for all 66 books of the Bible**.  

Each commentary is written at a seminary-level standard, integrating:
- Historical and cultural context  
- Original language analysis (Hebrew & Greek)

The goal is to help **pastors, seminarians, and believers** gain a deeper understanding of God’s Word,  
faithfully proclaiming truth in preaching, teaching, and devotion.

## 📜 Hermeneutical Principles

This project adheres strictly to six foundational principles of exegesis:

1. **“Sola Scriptura” — Scripture Alone** as the ultimate authority; all interpretation must be grounded in the self-witness of the Bible.  
2. **Reject all unverified mystical or charismatic interpretations**, avoiding subjective revelation or experience-driven readings.  
3. **Honor the original language structure, grammar, and semantics**, interpreting the author’s intent through textual and contextual study.  
4. **Ensure every argument can be traced back to the original text**, maintaining verifiability and academic rigor.  
5. **Maintain reverent, logical, and instructional tone**, resisting trends in pop psychology or emotional speculation.  
6. **Purpose:** To equip pastors and seminarians for a deeper grasp of Scripture and faithful proclamation of God’s Word to the Church.

3️⃣ **Literary & Theological Structure**  
　Reveals the logical flow, narrative design, and theological coherence.  

4️⃣ **Exegetical Dialogue & Commentary**  
　Engages with early church fathers, Reformers, and modern scholars’ perspectives.  

5️⃣ **Doctrinal & Redemptive Significance**  
　Interprets the text within the broader framework of salvation history and theology.  

6️⃣ **Homiletic & Pastoral Implications**
